# Privacy Comply Agent

The Privacy Comply Agent is an autonomous AI-powered privacy compliance system that integrates with AWS services to provide continuous monitoring, intelligent analysis, and automated remediation of privacy compliance violations.

## Architecture Overview

The system is built with a modular architecture consisting of the following core components:

### Core Services

1. **Privacy Risk Detection Service** (`services/privacy-risk-detector.ts`)
   - Monitors AWS resources for compliance violations
   - Integrates with S3, IAM, CloudTrail, Security Hub, and Macie
   - Detects PII exposure, access control issues, and encryption problems

2. **Compliance Reasoning Engine** (`services/compliance-reasoning-engine.ts`)
   - AI-powered analysis using Amazon Bedrock
   - Maps findings to legal articles (GDPR, PDPL, CCPA)
   - Generates risk scores and remediation recommendations

3. **Remediation Automation Service** (`services/remediation-automation-service.ts`)
   - Executes automated fixes through Lambda functions
   - Manages remediation workflows and approvals
   - Provides rollback capabilities

4. **Compliance Reporting Service** (`services/compliance-reporting-service.ts`)
   - Generates DPIA, RoPA, and audit reports
   - Stores reports securely in S3
   - Provides natural language summaries

5. **Natural Language Interface** (`services/natural-language-interface.ts`)
   - Processes natural language queries
   - Integrates with Amazon Q Business
   - Provides conversational access to compliance information

6. **Main Privacy Comply Agent** (`services/privacy-comply-agent.ts`)
   - Orchestrates all services
   - Provides unified API for compliance operations
   - Manages system health and monitoring

### Configuration and Infrastructure

- **AWS Configuration** (`config/aws-config.ts`)
  - Manages AWS credentials and service configurations
  - Supports environment variables and profiles
  - Validates configuration completeness

- **Service Clients** (`config/service-clients.ts`)
  - Factory for AWS service clients
  - Manages client instances and connectivity
  - Provides service-specific configurations

### Data Models

All TypeScript interfaces and types are defined in `types/index.ts`, including:

- AWS resource models (S3, IAM, etc.)
- Compliance finding structures
- Legal mapping interfaces
- Remediation and reporting models
- Natural language processing types

## Usage

### Basic Setup

```typescript
import { createPrivacyComplyAgent, testSystemReadiness } from './services/privacy-comply-agent';

// Test system readiness
const readiness = await testSystemReadiness();
if (!readiness.ready) {
  console.error('System not ready:', readiness.issues);
  return;
}

// Create agent instance
const agent = await createPrivacyComplyAgent();

// Initialize the agent
await agent.initialize();
```

### Running Compliance Scans

```typescript
// Run a complete compliance scan
const scanResults = await agent.runComplianceScan();
console.log('Findings:', scanResults.findings.length);
console.log('Assessments:', scanResults.assessments.length);

// Execute automated remediation
const remediationResults = await agent.executeAutomatedRemediation();
console.log('Remediations executed:', remediationResults.length);
```

### Generating Reports

```typescript
// Generate DPIA report
const dpiaReport = await agent.generateComplianceReport('DPIA');

// Generate audit report
const auditReport = await agent.generateComplianceReport('AUDIT');
```

### Natural Language Queries

```typescript
// Process natural language query
const response = await agent.processQuery(
  "What are our current GDPR compliance violations?"
);
console.log('Answer:', response.answer);
console.log('Related findings:', response.relatedFindings.length);
```

### Monitoring

```typescript
// Start continuous monitoring
await agent.startMonitoring();

// Get system status
const status = await agent.getSystemStatus();
console.log('System status:', status.status);
console.log('Active remediations:', status.activeRemediations);

// Get compliance health score
const healthScore = await agent.getComplianceHealthScore();
console.log('Overall score:', healthScore.overallScore);
```

## Environment Configuration

Set the following environment variables:

### AWS Configuration
```bash
AWS_REGION=us-east-1
AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=your-access-key
AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=your-secret-key
# OR use AWS profile
AWS_PROFILE=your-profile
```

### Service Configuration
```bash
# Amazon Bedrock
BEDROCK_MODEL_ID=anthropic.claude-3-sonnet-20240229-v1:0
BEDROCK_REGION=us-east-1

# S3 for reports
S3_REPORTS_BUCKET=privacy-comply-reports
S3_REGION=us-east-1

# DynamoDB for data storage
DYNAMODB_TABLE_NAME=privacy-comply-data
DYNAMODB_REGION=us-east-1

# SageMaker for ML
SAGEMAKER_ENDPOINT_NAME=privacy-comply-endpoint
SAGEMAKER_REGION=us-east-1
```

## Development Status

This is the initial project structure and interface definitions. The actual implementations will be added in subsequent tasks:

- **Task 2**: Privacy Risk Detection Service implementation
- **Task 3**: Compliance Reasoning Engine implementation
- **Task 4**: Remediation Automation Service implementation
- **Task 5**: Compliance Reporting Service implementation
- **Task 6**: Natural Language Interface implementation
- **Task 7**: Machine Learning components implementation
- **Task 8**: Main agent orchestration implementation
- **Task 9**: API endpoints and UI integration
- **Task 10**: AWS infrastructure deployment

## Integration with PrivacyGuard

The Privacy Comply Agent integrates with the existing PrivacyGuard platform by:

1. **Extending the service layer** - Added under `src/services/privacy-comply-agent/`
2. **Reusing existing infrastructure** - Leverages current AWS integrations and UI components
3. **Following established patterns** - Uses TypeScript interfaces and service-oriented architecture
4. **Maintaining compatibility** - Designed to work alongside existing privacy management features

The agent can be integrated into the main PrivacyGuard dashboard to provide:
- Autonomous compliance monitoring
- AI-powered risk assessment
- Automated remediation capabilities
- Enhanced reporting and analytics
