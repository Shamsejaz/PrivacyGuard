# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for implementing Model Context Protocol (MCP) integrations within the PrivacyComply Agent system. The feature will enable real-time privacy scanning and consent management across connected external systems including CRM platforms, content management systems, email/chat platforms, and cloud storage services.

## Glossary

- **MCP**: Model Context Protocol - A standardized protocol for connecting AI agents to external systems
- **PrivacyComply Agent**: The core AI-powered PrivacyOps and Compliance Automation system
- **PII**: Personally Identifiable Information
- **CRM**: Customer Relationship Management system
- **CMS**: Content Management System
- **DPO**: Data Protection Officer
- **DSAR**: Data Subject Access Request
- **Privacy_Scanner**: The MCP-enabled component that performs privacy scans across connected systems
- **Connector_Module**: Individual MCP integration modules for specific platforms
- **Compliance_Dashboard**: The main dashboard interface displaying compliance metrics and scan results

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a Data Protection Officer, I want to automatically discover and classify PII data across all connected CRM systems, so that I can maintain comprehensive visibility of personal data processing activities.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the Privacy_Scanner connects to a CRM system via MCP, THE Privacy_Scanner SHALL authenticate using secure API credentials
2. WHEN scanning CRM records, THE Privacy_Scanner SHALL identify PII fields including names, emails, phone numbers, addresses, and custom sensitive fields
3. WHEN PII is detected in CRM records, THE Privacy_Scanner SHALL classify the data sensitivity level as low, medium, or high risk
4. WHEN consent status is expired or missing, THE Privacy_Scanner SHALL flag records for review and potential remediation
5. THE Privacy_Scanner SHALL generate audit logs for all CRM scanning activities with timestamps and data classifications

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a Compliance Manager, I want to automatically scan website content and detect privacy policy violations, so that I can ensure our web presence complies with privacy regulations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the Privacy_Scanner connects to a CMS via MCP, THE Privacy_Scanner SHALL crawl all published pages and posts
2. WHEN scanning web content, THE Privacy_Scanner SHALL detect exposed PII including email addresses, phone numbers, and identification numbers
3. WHEN third-party tracking scripts are detected, THE Privacy_Scanner SHALL identify and catalog all external data processors
4. IF PII exposure is found on public pages, THEN THE Privacy_Scanner SHALL generate high-priority alerts for immediate remediation
5. THE Privacy_Scanner SHALL produce structured privacy audit reports with remediation recommendations

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a Privacy Officer, I want to monitor email and chat communications for risky PII sharing behaviors, so that I can prevent data breaches and ensure secure communication practices.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the Privacy_Scanner connects to email/chat systems via MCP, THE Privacy_Scanner SHALL scan recent messages and attachments for PII patterns
2. WHEN PII is shared with external recipients, THE Privacy_Scanner SHALL flag the communication for DPO review
3. WHEN sensitive attachments are detected, THE Privacy_Scanner SHALL verify encryption status and access controls
4. THE Privacy_Scanner SHALL generate anonymized summaries of communication risks without exposing message content
5. IF high-risk PII sharing is detected, THEN THE Privacy_Scanner SHALL send immediate alerts to designated privacy personnel

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a Cloud Security Administrator, I want to perform automated privacy scans on cloud storage systems, so that I can ensure proper data protection and retention compliance.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the Privacy_Scanner connects to cloud storage via MCP, THE Privacy_Scanner SHALL scan files and databases for unencrypted PII
2. WHEN data retention policies are violated, THE Privacy_Scanner SHALL identify files eligible for deletion or archival
3. WHEN unencrypted sensitive data is found, THE Privacy_Scanner SHALL recommend encryption or access control improvements
4. THE Privacy_Scanner SHALL tag cloud resources with privacy classification metadata for ongoing monitoring
5. THE Privacy_Scanner SHALL integrate with existing cloud security policies and compliance frameworks

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a System Administrator, I want to execute unified privacy scans across all connected systems, so that I can maintain a comprehensive view of organizational privacy posture.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN executing a global privacy scan, THE Privacy_Scanner SHALL coordinate scans across all configured MCP connectors simultaneously
2. WHEN scan results are collected, THE Privacy_Scanner SHALL aggregate findings into a unified compliance dashboard
3. WHEN remediation actions are required, THE Privacy_Scanner SHALL provide automated options for data masking, deletion, or encryption
4. THE Privacy_Scanner SHALL generate executive-level compliance reports with risk scores and trend analysis
5. THE Privacy_Scanner SHALL expose RESTful APIs for integration with external compliance management systems

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a Developer, I want modular MCP connector architecture, so that I can easily add new platform integrations without affecting existing functionality.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Connector_Module SHALL implement standardized MCP interfaces for consistent integration patterns
2. WHEN adding new connectors, THE Connector_Module SHALL support hot-plugging without system restart
3. THE Connector_Module SHALL provide configuration management for API credentials and scanning parameters
4. THE Connector_Module SHALL implement error handling and retry logic for robust operation
5. THE Connector_Module SHALL support both real-time and scheduled scanning modes

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a Privacy Team Member, I want real-time notifications and dashboard updates, so that I can respond quickly to privacy incidents and compliance issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN privacy violations are detected, THE Compliance_Dashboard SHALL display real-time alerts with severity indicators
2. WHEN scan results are updated, THE Compliance_Dashboard SHALL refresh metrics and visualizations automatically
3. THE Compliance_Dashboard SHALL provide drill-down capabilities from summary metrics to detailed findings
4. THE Compliance_Dashboard SHALL support role-based access controls for different user types
5. THE Compliance_Dashboard SHALL integrate with existing PrivacyComply notification systems and workflows
