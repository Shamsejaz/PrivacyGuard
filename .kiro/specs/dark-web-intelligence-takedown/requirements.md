# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Dark Web Intelligence & Automated Takedown feature extends PrivacyGuard's capabilities to proactively monitor dark web sources and public paste sites for leaked personal data, credentials, and corporate information. This system integrates with threat intelligence APIs through MCP connectors, uses AWS Bedrock for intelligent analysis, and leverages Amazon Nova Act for automated remediation actions. The feature provides privacy and security teams with comprehensive visibility into data exposure risks and automated response capabilities.

## Glossary

- **Dark_Web_Intelligence_System**: The complete system encompassing monitoring, detection, analysis, and takedown capabilities
- **MCP_Connector**: Model Context Protocol connector that interfaces with external dark web and threat intelligence APIs
- **Threat_Intelligence_API**: External services like Constella, IntSights, or DeHashed that provide dark web monitoring data
- **Nova_Act_Engine**: Amazon Nova Act service used for automated UI-driven takedown actions
- **Evidence_Store**: AWS S3 bucket with KMS encryption for storing sanitized evidence and scan results
- **Takedown_Request**: Automated or manual request to remove leaked data from dark web sources
- **Risk_Score**: Calculated confidence level based on exposure type, recency, and data sensitivity
- **Sanitized_Summary**: Redacted report containing threat intelligence without exposing additional PII
- **Privacy_Officer**: User role responsible for managing data privacy and breach response
- **Bedrock_Agent**: AWS Bedrock-powered AI agent for analyzing and categorizing threats

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a Privacy Officer, I want to monitor dark web sources for leaked personal data and credentials related to my organization, so that I can quickly identify and respond to data breaches.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the Privacy Officer configures monitoring keywords, THE Dark_Web_Intelligence_System SHALL scan Threat_Intelligence_API sources for matches
2. WHEN leaked data is detected, THE Dark_Web_Intelligence_System SHALL generate a Sanitized_Summary within 15 minutes
3. WHEN scan results are available, THE Dark_Web_Intelligence_System SHALL calculate a Risk_Score based on exposure type and recency
4. WHERE monitoring is enabled, THE Dark_Web_Intelligence_System SHALL perform automated scans every 4 hours
5. WHILE processing scan results, THE Dark_Web_Intelligence_System SHALL redact all PII from summaries sent to the Bedrock_Agent

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a Privacy Officer, I want to automatically initiate takedown requests for leaked data, so that I can minimize exposure time and reduce privacy risks.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN high-risk leaked data is detected, THE Dark_Web_Intelligence_System SHALL trigger automated Takedown_Request via Nova_Act_Engine
2. WHEN a Takedown_Request is initiated, THE Nova_Act_Engine SHALL perform UI-driven actions to contact site administrators
3. WHEN takedown actions are completed, THE Nova_Act_Engine SHALL capture screenshots and logs for compliance evidence
4. WHERE manual approval is required, THE Dark_Web_Intelligence_System SHALL send notification to Privacy Officer before executing Takedown_Request
5. WHILE executing takedown actions, THE Nova_Act_Engine SHALL chain tasks in sequence: detect, classify, remediate, document

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a Privacy Officer, I want to securely store evidence of data breaches and takedown actions, so that I can maintain compliance audit trails and legal documentation.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN evidence is collected, THE Dark_Web_Intelligence_System SHALL store sanitized data in Evidence_Store with KMS encryption
2. WHEN storing evidence, THE Dark_Web_Intelligence_System SHALL generate signed URLs with 30-day expiry for secure access
3. WHEN takedown actions are completed, THE Dark_Web_Intelligence_System SHALL log all activities in DynamoDB with CloudTrail integration
4. WHERE evidence contains PII, THE Dark_Web_Intelligence_System SHALL apply redaction before storage
5. WHILE maintaining audit trails, THE Dark_Web_Intelligence_System SHALL record timestamp, action type, and outcome for each event

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a Privacy Officer, I want to receive real-time notifications about critical data exposures, so that I can respond immediately to high-risk situations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN critical exposure is detected, THE Dark_Web_Intelligence_System SHALL send immediate notification via Amazon SNS
2. WHEN SNS notification is triggered, THE Dark_Web_Intelligence_System SHALL deliver alerts to Microsoft Teams or Slack channels
3. WHEN notification is sent, THE Dark_Web_Intelligence_System SHALL include Risk_Score and recommended actions
4. WHERE multiple exposures are detected, THE Dark_Web_Intelligence_System SHALL consolidate notifications to prevent alert fatigue
5. WHILE processing notifications, THE Dark_Web_Intelligence_System SHALL ensure no PII is included in alert messages

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a Privacy Officer, I want to visualize dark web monitoring results and takedown status through a dashboard, so that I can track trends and manage ongoing incidents.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN accessing the dashboard, THE Dark_Web_Intelligence_System SHALL display scan history with Risk_Score visualization
2. WHEN viewing takedown status, THE Dark_Web_Intelligence_System SHALL show progress tracking for each Takedown_Request
3. WHEN analyzing trends, THE Dark_Web_Intelligence_System SHALL provide charts showing exposure patterns over time
4. WHERE evidence is available, THE Dark_Web_Intelligence_System SHALL provide secure access links to Evidence_Store
5. WHILE displaying results, THE Dark_Web_Intelligence_System SHALL ensure all PII is redacted from dashboard views

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a System Administrator, I want to configure and manage MCP connectors for different threat intelligence providers, so that I can integrate multiple data sources securely.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN configuring MCP_Connector, THE Dark_Web_Intelligence_System SHALL validate API credentials using AWS Secrets Manager
2. WHEN multiple Threat_Intelligence_API sources are configured, THE Dark_Web_Intelligence_System SHALL aggregate results with source attribution
3. WHEN API rate limits are reached, THE Dark_Web_Intelligence_System SHALL implement exponential backoff and retry logic
4. WHERE connector fails, THE Dark_Web_Intelligence_System SHALL log errors and continue with available sources
5. WHILE managing connectors, THE Dark_Web_Intelligence_System SHALL apply least privilege IAM policies for all AWS service access

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a Privacy Officer, I want to export compliance reports about dark web monitoring and takedown activities, so that I can provide documentation to auditors and regulators.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN generating reports, THE Dark_Web_Intelligence_System SHALL create PDF exports with sanitized evidence summaries
2. WHEN exporting data, THE Dark_Web_Intelligence_System SHALL include takedown success rates and response times
3. WHEN creating compliance documentation, THE Dark_Web_Intelligence_System SHALL format reports according to GDPR and CCPA requirements
4. WHERE sensitive data is included, THE Dark_Web_Intelligence_System SHALL apply appropriate redaction levels
5. WHILE generating reports, THE Dark_Web_Intelligence_System SHALL maintain data integrity and audit trail consistency
