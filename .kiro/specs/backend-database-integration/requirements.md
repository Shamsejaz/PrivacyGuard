# Backend Database Integration Requirements

## Introduction

This specification defines the requirements for replacing mock data throughout the PrivacyGuard application with real database connections and backend API services. The system currently uses hardcoded mock data in React components and needs to be transformed into a production-ready application with proper data persistence, API endpoints, and real-time data synchronization.

## Glossary

- **PrivacyGuard_System**: The complete PrivacyGuard application including frontend, backend APIs, and database layers
- **Mock_Data**: Hardcoded arrays and objects currently used in React components for demonstration purposes
- **Backend_API**: RESTful API services that will provide data to the frontend application
- **Database_Layer**: Persistent storage systems including relational and document databases
- **Real_Time_Service**: WebSocket or Server-Sent Events service for live data updates
- **Authentication_Service**: JWT-based authentication and authorization system
- **Data_Sync_Engine**: Service responsible for synchronizing data between different systems and maintaining consistency

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want to replace all mock data with real database connections, so that the application can store and retrieve actual privacy compliance data.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the PrivacyGuard_System starts, THE Backend_API SHALL connect to configured Database_Layer instances
2. WHEN a component requests data, THE Backend_API SHALL retrieve current data from the Database_Layer instead of returning Mock_Data
3. WHEN data is modified through the UI, THE Backend_API SHALL persist changes to the Database_Layer
4. WHERE database connection fails, THE PrivacyGuard_System SHALL provide graceful error handling and fallback mechanisms
5. THE Database_Layer SHALL support both relational data (PostgreSQL) and document storage (MongoDB) for different data types

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a privacy officer, I want real-time data updates across all dashboard components, so that I can monitor compliance status and risk metrics as they change.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN compliance data changes in the Database_Layer, THE Real_Time_Service SHALL notify connected frontend clients
2. WHEN risk metrics are updated, THE PrivacyGuard_System SHALL broadcast changes to all active dashboard sessions
3. WHILE monitoring real-time data, THE PrivacyGuard_System SHALL maintain WebSocket connections with automatic reconnection
4. THE Real_Time_Service SHALL support selective subscriptions to specific data types and user permissions
5. IF connection is lost, THEN THE PrivacyGuard_System SHALL queue updates and synchronize when connection is restored

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a comprehensive API layer with proper authentication and authorization, so that all data access is secure and auditable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Backend_API SHALL implement JWT-based authentication for all endpoints
2. WHEN accessing protected resources, THE Authentication_Service SHALL validate user permissions and roles
3. THE Backend_API SHALL provide RESTful endpoints for all current mock data categories including DSAR, GDPR, PDPL, risk assessment, and policy management
4. THE PrivacyGuard_System SHALL log all API requests and data modifications for audit purposes
5. WHERE unauthorized access is attempted, THE Authentication_Service SHALL deny access and log security events

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a compliance manager, I want all DSAR (Data Subject Access Request) data to be stored persistently, so that I can track request status and maintain compliance records.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Database_Layer SHALL store DSAR requests with complete audit trails and status history
2. WHEN a DSAR request is submitted, THE Backend_API SHALL create persistent records with unique identifiers
3. THE PrivacyGuard_System SHALL support DSAR workflow state transitions with proper validation
4. THE Backend_API SHALL provide endpoints for DSAR portal user submissions and admin management
5. WHILE processing DSAR requests, THE Data_Sync_Engine SHALL maintain data consistency across related systems

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a data protection officer, I want risk assessment and compliance monitoring data to be stored in a structured database, so that I can generate reports and track trends over time.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Database_Layer SHALL store risk metrics, vulnerability assessments, and compliance gap analysis data
2. WHEN risk assessments are performed, THE Backend_API SHALL persist results with timestamps and metadata
3. THE PrivacyGuard_System SHALL support historical data queries for trend analysis and reporting
4. THE Backend_API SHALL provide aggregation endpoints for dashboard metrics and analytics
5. THE Database_Layer SHALL maintain referential integrity between risk assessments and related compliance requirements

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a system integrator, I want the application to connect with existing enterprise databases and external APIs, so that privacy data can be synchronized with other business systems.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Backend_API SHALL support connections to MongoDB, MySQL, and PostgreSQL databases as configured
2. WHEN integrating with external systems, THE Data_Sync_Engine SHALL handle data transformation and mapping
3. THE PrivacyGuard_System SHALL provide configuration management for database connection strings and API endpoints
4. THE Backend_API SHALL implement retry logic and error handling for external system connections
5. WHERE data conflicts occur during synchronization, THE Data_Sync_Engine SHALL provide conflict resolution mechanisms

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a privacy compliance team member, I want policy management and GDPR compliance data to be centrally stored and versioned, so that I can maintain accurate compliance documentation.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Database_Layer SHALL store policy documents, GDPR records, and compliance matrices with version control
2. WHEN policies are updated, THE Backend_API SHALL create new versions while preserving historical records
3. THE PrivacyGuard_System SHALL support document relationships and cross-references between compliance artifacts
4. THE Backend_API SHALL provide search and filtering capabilities across all compliance documentation
5. THE Database_Layer SHALL maintain data integrity constraints for compliance requirement relationships

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want comprehensive error handling and monitoring for all database operations, so that I can ensure system reliability and performance.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Backend_API SHALL implement comprehensive error handling for all database operations
2. WHEN database errors occur, THE PrivacyGuard_System SHALL log detailed error information and provide user-friendly messages
3. THE Backend_API SHALL include health check endpoints for monitoring database connectivity and performance
4. THE PrivacyGuard_System SHALL implement connection pooling and query optimization for database efficiency
5. WHERE system performance degrades, THE Backend_API SHALL provide metrics and alerting for proactive monitoring
