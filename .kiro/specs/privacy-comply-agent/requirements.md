# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The PrivacyComply Agent is an autonomous AI Privacy Compliance Agent designed to ensure data protection and regulatory compliance across AWS environments. The system continuously monitors, analyzes, and improves the organization's compliance with privacy regulations such as GDPR, PDPL (Saudi Arabia), and CCPA (California). It identifies data exposure risks, maps them to legal articles, and recommends or executes remediations autonomously.

4. WHEN the PrivacyComply Agent discovers publicly accessible resources, THE Privacy Risk Detection System SHALL flag resources containing personal data
5. THE Privacy Risk Detection System SHALL integrate with AWS Security Hub, Macie, and CloudTrail for comprehensive monitoring

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a Compliance Manager, I want the system to automatically map detected issues to specific legal articles, so that I can understand the regulatory implications of each finding.

#### Acceptance Criteria

3. WHEN the Compliance Reasoning Engine analyzes access violations, THE Compliance Reasoning Engine SHALL map the issue to relevant CCPA provisions
4. THE Compliance Reasoning Engine SHALL use Amazon Bedrock reasoning models for legal article mapping
5. THE Compliance Reasoning Engine SHALL provide confidence scores for each legal mapping with minimum 0.8 accuracy

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a DevOps Engineer, I want the system to automatically remediate common compliance issues, so that I can reduce manual intervention and response time.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the Remediation Automation System identifies a publicly accessible S3 bucket with PII, THE Remediation Automation System SHALL automatically restrict public access
2. WHEN the Remediation Automation System detects unencrypted sensitive data storage, THE Remediation Automation System SHALL enable default encryption
3. WHEN the Remediation Automation System finds overprivileged IAM roles, THE Remediation Automation System SHALL recommend principle of least privilege adjustments
4. THE Remediation Automation System SHALL execute remediation actions through AWS Lambda workflows
5. THE Remediation Automation System SHALL log all automated actions for audit trail purposes

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a Data Protection Officer, I want the system to generate comprehensive compliance reports, so that I can demonstrate regulatory compliance to auditors and stakeholders.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the Compliance Reporting System processes compliance data, THE Compliance Reporting System SHALL generate Data Protection Impact Assessments (DPIA)
2. WHEN the Compliance Reporting System analyzes processing activities, THE Compliance Reporting System SHALL create Records of Processing Activities (RoPA)
